## 4.0.1
  - General improvements to code and docs [#29](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-cipher/pull/29)
    - Fixed threadsafety; this plugin can now be used in pipelines with more than one worker.
    - Fixed a potential leak of the configured key into logs; the key is now only included if trace-level logging is enabled.
    - Fixed an issue where configurations that used invalid `mode` or `algorithm` settings could produce unhelpful error messages.
    - Fixed an issue where a bad payload could cause the plugin to crash; when exceptions are encountered, the offending event will now be tagged with `_cipherfiltererror`.
    - Improved documentation substantially.
